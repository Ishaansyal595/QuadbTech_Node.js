I apologize for not being able to complete the Node.js assignment as requested. Despite my best efforts to familiarize myself with Node.js, I encountered challenges due to my lack of prior experience with the technology. However, I took the initiative to develop the HoldInfo website using my proficiency in HTML and CSS. I appreciate the opportunity and remain committed to continually enhancing my skills to better contribute to future projects.
